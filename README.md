Alteran
=======

Alteran framework is a starfall framework which makes your life coding it in Garry's mod much easier.
This framework will only work on the [TSCM Garry's Mod server](http://teamscm.co.uk/), as there are a lot of custom functions used in this framework that are only available on that server.
