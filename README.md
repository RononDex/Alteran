Alteran
=======

Alteran framework is a starfall framework which makes your life much easier when coding with Starfall in Garry's mod.
This framework will only work on the [TSCM Garry's Mod server](http://teamscm.co.uk/), as there are a lot of custom functions used in this framework that are only available on that server.

It is currently in a really early state. The first versions will mainly feature GUI (Graphical user interface) stuff (like touchscreen button, ...).
